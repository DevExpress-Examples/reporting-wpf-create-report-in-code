# Reporting for WPF - How to create a report in code


This example illustrates the process of creating a report in code in a WPF application.Â 

The following steps are essential to create a report layout:

1. Create a report class instance andÂ [bind it to data](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/15034/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/bind-reports-to-data).
2. Add [bands](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2587/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/introduction-to-banded-reports)Â to the report.
3. Add [controls](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2605/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-report-controls)Â to the created bands and bind them to data.

After the report layout is complete, you can generate the report document and display it in the [Print Preview](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/15016/wpf-reporting/wpf-reporting-document-preview).

Starting with v.17.2, the report usesÂ [binding expressions](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/1180/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-report-controls/bind-report-controls-to-data/specify-a-control-s-binding-expression)Â to bind controls to data. You can switch to the legacy binding mode by setting theÂ [UserDesignerOptions.DataBindingMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Configuration.UserDesignerOptions.DataBindingMode)Â property toÂ <strong>Bindings</strong> at the application start.
